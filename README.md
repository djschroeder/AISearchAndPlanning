# **Search & Planning in Artificial Intelligence**

## **Course Overview**

This repository contains projects and assignments from the CMPUT 366 course at the University of Alberta. The course covers deterministic single-agent and multi-agent problems, modeling real-world problems as state-space search problems, and solving these with various algorithms.

## **Projects**

Each project in this repository corresponds to a key topic covered in the course, including heuristic search, multi-agent pathfinding, game theory, and constraint satisfaction, among others.

## **How to Use**

For detailed information on each project, please refer to the PDF file contained within each project directory.

## **Note on Code and Files**

The majority of the code and files in this repository were not created by me, only small portions were. This repository is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate understanding and application of various AI and machine learning concepts.

## **Acknowledgements**

These projects were completed as part of the CMPUT 366 course under the guidance of Professor Levi Santana de Lelis.
