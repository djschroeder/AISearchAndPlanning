# Search & Planning in Artificial Intelligence

## Course Overview
This repository contains projects and assignments from the CMPUT 366 course at the University of Alberta. The course covers deterministic single-agent and multi-agent problems, modeling real-world problems as state-space search problems, and solving these with various algorithms.

## Projects
Each project in this repository corresponds to a key topic covered in the course, including heuristic search, multi-agent pathfinding, game theory, and constraint satisfaction, among others.

## How to Use
Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions on building, running, and understanding the project.

## Acknowledgements
These projects were completed as part of the CMPUT 366 course under the guidance of Professor Levi Santana de Lelis. They are meant for educational purposes to demonstrate various AI and machine learning concepts.
